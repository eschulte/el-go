;; A board-based interface to GO games which may be connected to a
;; number of GO back-ends through a generic API.  To play a game of GO
;; against the gnugo back-end run `play-go'.  Current back-ends
;; include the following.
;; - the SGF format
;; - the Go Text Protocol (GTP)
;; - TODO: the IGS protocol
